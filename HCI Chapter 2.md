# Chapter 2 - Introduction to Interaction Design

## User Experience

- How a product behaves and is used by people in the real world
    - the way people about it and their pleasure and satisfaction when using it, looking at it, holding it, and opening or closing it
    - "every product that is used by someone has a user experience: newspapers, ketchup bottles, reclining armchairs, cardigan sweaters." (Garrett, 2010)
    - "all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products." (Nielsen and Norman, 2014)
- Cannot desig√èn a user experience, only design **for** a user experience

## What is involved in the process of interaction design

- Establishing requirements
- Developing alternatives
- Prototyping
- Evaluating

## Core characteristics of interaction design

- Users should be involved through the development of the project
- Specific usability and user experience goals need to be identified, clearly documented and agreed at the beginning of the project
- Iteration is needed through the core activities

## Quality of Interactive System

- Usability
    - Extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goal with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction.
- User experience
    - Quality of experience a person has when interacting with a specific design
    - ISO 9241-210: User experience is defined as "a person's perceptions and responses that result from the use of a product, system or service"

## Usability Goals
**Use Mel**

| Goals | Explaination |
|---------|----------|
| Effectiveness | must be able to do what it is designed to do. |
| Efficiency | supports user in carrying out the tasks. |
| Safety | protect users from dangerous conditions |
| Utility | provides the right kind of functionality so that users can do what they need or what to do
| Learnability | learn the system through self-exploration |
| Memorability | remember how to use the system |

## User Experience Goals

- Covers range of emotions and felt experiences.
- Mostly subjective qualities and depends on how a system feels to a user.

## Design Rules

- Goal of interaction design is to design for maximum usability
- Rules a designer can follow in order to increase the usability of the eventual software product.
- Important to know the origin of design rules.
- Types of design rules:
    1. Principles
    1. Guidelines
    1. Standards

## Design Standards

- Usually set by national or international bodies to ensure compliance with a set of design rules by a large community.
- Standards can apply **specifically** to either the hardware or the software used to build the interactive system.
- Usually rules are built on **concrete underlying theories**

### ISO 9241-210

- Previously known as ISO 13407 (1999)
- Standard for "human-centered design of interactive system"
- Six key principles:
    - Understanding of users, task and environments
    - Users involvement
    - Refinement of design by user evaluation
    - Design addresses the whole user experience
    - Iterative process
    - Design team: Multidisciplinary team

## Design Guidelines

- Guidelines are less abstract and often more technology oriented, but as they are also general, it is important for a designer to know what theoretical evidence there is to support them.

## Design Principles

- Principles are derived from knowledge of the psychological, computational and sociological aspects of the problem domains and are largely indepent of the technology.
- They depend to a much greater extent on a deeper understanding of the human element in the interaction.
- They can be therefore be applied widely but are not so useful for specific design advice.
- Spells out the do's and don'ts of interaction design and/or what to provide and what not to provide at the interface

### Benyon - Design Principles

- Grouped into three category:
    - Learnability
    - Effectiveness
    - Accomodation
        - Concern with accommodating differences between people and respecting those differences.

### Dix - Design Principles

- Three main categories:
    - Learnability
    - Flexibility
    - Robustness

## Golden Rules and Heuristics

- Useful check list for good design
- Better design using these than using nothing
- Heuristics - Guideline / General principle / Rule of thumb that can guide a design or critique design already made.
- Different collections :
    - Shneiderman's EIGHT Golden Rules
    - Norman's SEVEN Principles
    - Nielsen TEN Usability Heuristics

### Shneiderman's EIGHT Golden Rules

- Provide a convenient and succinct summary of the key principles of interface design
- Intended to be used during design but can also be used for evaluating systems.
- Like design principles, they are not applicable to every eventuality and need to be interpreted for each new situation

1. Strive for consistenct
1. Enable frequent users to use shortcuts
1. Offer informative feedback
1. Design dialogs to yield closure
1. Offer error prevention and simple error handling
1. Permit easy reversal of actions
1. Support internal locus of control
1. Reduce short-term memory load

### Norman's SEVEN Principles

1. Use both knowledge in the world and knowledge in the head.
1. Simplify the structure of tasks.
1. Make things visible: bridge the gulfs of Execution and Evaluation.
1. Get the mappings right.
1. Exploit the power of constraints, both natural and artificial.
1. Design for error.
1. When all else fails, standardize.

## Design Patterns / HCI Patterns

- One way to approach design is to learn from examples that have proven to be successful in the past: to reuse the knowledge of what made a system - or paradigm - successful
- Patterns are an approach to capturing and reusing this knowledge - of abstracting the essential details of successful design so that these can be applied again and again in new situations

|-------|-------------|
| Principles | <li>abstract design rules</li><li>low authority</li><li>high generality</li> |
| Standards | <li>specific</li><li>high athority</li><li>limited application</li> |

## Applying the Rules to Practice

- Which rule should I use while I am designing?
    - Understand the basis of the rules (especially guidelines and principles) before applying it.
    - Applying more than one design principle in interaction design can be problematic
